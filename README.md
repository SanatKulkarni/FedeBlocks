# FedeBlocks 🔐

Project Link: https://uzeioxxtpffnfq6n.vercel.app/

A privacy-preserving federated learning platform using ZK-SNARKs on Ethereum blockchain.

## Overview

FedeBlocks enables AI models to learn from distributed data sources while maintaining complete privacy through zero-knowledge proofs. By combining federated learning with blockchain technology, we ensure both data privacy and computation integrity.

## Features

- 🔒 Privacy-preserving model training using ZK-SNARKs
- 🌐 Decentralized federated learning on Ethereum
- ✅ Verifiable computation integrity
- 🤝 Secure model update aggregation
- 📱 Client-side computation support
